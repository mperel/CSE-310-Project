There are four main files in this project:
  TCPServer.java
  TCPClient.java
  Player.java
  GameRoom.java
  
These files must all be in the same directory to work.

To get the server/client to work, open the command prompt/terminal in the directory where the project is located and execute the following commands:
  javac TCPServer.java/TCPClient.java
  java TCPServer/TCPJava
